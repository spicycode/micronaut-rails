= Micronaut Rails

* http://github.com/spicycode/micronaut-rails

== DESCRIPTION:

Micronaut Rails is a set of extension to deal with rails mode testing. For the moment think of it is a prototype of
RSpec lite.  Definitely pre alpha at the moment.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby 1.8.6+
* ActionPack
*  Micronaut (via spicycode-micronaut on GitHub) -- version numbers are kept in sync, excluding the fourth version part.  So 
		micronaut-rails 0.1.7.5 should be compatible with micronaut 0.1.7, but micronaut-rails 0.1.8.0 would require micronaut >= 0.1.8.

== ISSUES

* No support for pure Rails fixtures (we use Factory Girl/Fixture Replacement instead, so send a patch if you want support for this)
* In use in real-world projects on Rails 2.2+ - older versions may have issues.

== CREDITS:

* RSpec for the great ideas and matchers
